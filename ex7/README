 * DESCRIPTION: this program creates 4 threads (MAIN , PRIME,PALINDROME,
 *				CLIENTS ). the main thread creates the other threads then
 *				saves their id's in a global array and finishes his work,
 *				the clients thread gets from user what operation he asks
 *				to do ( PRIME or PALINDROME ) then gets the needed numbers
 *				from user and sends a signal to the thread who needs them,
 *				the thread makes the demanded process and updates the solution
 *				to the program, then sends back a signal to the client to
 *				inform him the solution is ready and the program is ready for 
 *				another client.
