 * ex2a.c : the main process execute child process which runs in infinite loop, in each iteration he 
 * performs a random number whenever he performs 100,000 numbers he finishes.
 * if the child finishes his mission in less than 1 secs he prints "1"and exits, if he finishes within
 *  2 secs he prints "2" and exits, if he doesn't finishes in less that 2 secs the main process kills
 *  him and prints "0".
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Compile: gcc -Wall ex2a.c -o ex2a
 * Run: ./ex2a
 * ===================================================================================================
 * ex2b.c : this program has 2 processes - dad and child.
 * 			each process run in infinite loop, goes sleeping for 3 seconds(max)
 *  		and Performs a random of numbers.
 * 			the chosen number can be 0 or 1 or 2.
 *
 *			if the chosen number is 0, the current process ends.
 *			
 *			if the chosen number is 1 or 2, the current process sends signal SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2
 *			(depending on the received signal) to the second process. else, he sends signal siguser2.
 *
 *	 		each siguser has counter, that counts how much this signal appears.
 *
 *	 		while one of them appers 5 times, the program prints which process
 *	 		"surrender", and sends sigterm to the second signal and finish.
 *
 *	 		the sigterm prints which process "won".
