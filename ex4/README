 * ex4a1.c: this program runs as an application server , before start the server wait tell 
 * 			he gets the numbers of all clients. after that he gets a random numbers from each
 * 			client and stores it in array. for each random number the 
 * 			server gets he return a feedback as integer which represents the apperance
 * 			times for this number in the array. after the array is full the server sends
 * 			end message to all clients.
 * 			when finished the server prints how many distincit numbers he has in the array
 * 			and what is the max and the min numbers.

 * Compile: gcc -Wall ex4a1.c -o ex4a1
 * Run: ./ex4a1 fifo0 fifo1 fifo2 fifo3
 * ===================================================================================================
 * ex4a2.c: this program runs as a client. first it sends it's file number for the  server,
 * 			then itgenerates a random number  and check if it  is a prime number.
 * 			for each number the client send it gets a feedback from a server that indicates
 * 			how much this numbers appears in the storing array. when the storing array 
 * 			is ready the client gets ending feedback and prints how many numbers it 
 * 			send was new and prints the max times sent of a number.

 * Compile: gcc -Wall ex4a2.c -o ex4a2
 * Run: ./ex4a2 fifo0 <file_num>

 * ex4b1.c: this program runs as an application server that comunicates this it's clients
 * 			through a message queue. before start the server wait tell

 * 			client and stores it in array. for each random number the 
 * 			server gets he return a feedback as integer which represents the apperance

 * ex4b2.c: this program runs as a client which comunicate with the server through a
