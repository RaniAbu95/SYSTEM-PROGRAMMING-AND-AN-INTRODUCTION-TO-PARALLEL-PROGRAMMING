File: ex5a1.c 
=============================================================
 * DESCRIPTION: this program works with shared data,
 * its a server which creae array of 995 number and 
 * the client should fill it with prime numbers.
 * after the array is full the prog prints how much
 * distinct numbers it have what is the min and max.
 *
 * compile: gcc ex5a1.c -o ex5a1
 * run: ./ex5a1

 * Notes:
 * there are so many running options, the 3 process could work differently
 * such as the first process can fill most of the array numbers,
 * same case for second process and third process, each process can find
 * different number of numbers.

File: ex5a2.c 
=============================================================
 * DESCRIPTION: this program works with shared memory,
 * it works as clients which fill the shared array with numbers
 * when it's full it prints how many numbers was added as new 
 * and from all numbers sent what is the max apperance of a given number.
 
 * compile: gcc ex5a2.c -o ex5a2
 * run: ./ex5a2 <process_num>

File: ex5b3.c 
=============================================================
 * DESCRIPTION: this program works with shared memory,
 * this program works as clients, sending numbers to other
 * servers to work with. 
 * this program shares data with a PRIME and PALINDROME servers.
